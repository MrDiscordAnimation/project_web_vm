# project_web_vm
It's some funny and strange project I made to just simulate a PC Experience.
You can download or view it here: https://mrdiscordanimation.github.io/project_web_vm/
## Script Fix Update
HII! I fixed this Script so it's iPad Friendly Bye!
### What does this Project Include?
It has a Built In Notepad, A Setting App, Project Sussy Land: Web Edition (Coming Soon!) and lastly a Password Protected File or PPF (Password: **sus**)
### What can I do in Settings?
You have 3 Options in Settings which include:
- Reset to Factory Settings
- Shut Down
- Easter Eggs
#### What does the Easter Eggs button do in Settings?
Go Ahead and find out for yourself. I'm not spoiling the thing for you.
#### Why is Sussy Land image shows [MDATimes](https://cdn.mrdiscord.repl.co/mdatimes.html)?
I have no ideas for Sussy Land Spoilers Cover so that's why I used [MDATimes](https://cdn.mrdiscord.repl.co/mdatimes.html) Mascot instead.
### What can I do in Notepad?
You can save notes there. Keep in mind that you can only save **one note only** and why did I designed that?
The reason is I am too lazy to create a Storage File System until Version 2.9.9/3.0.0 and another reason is school.
#### Why is there only 2 Image Files isn't there 4????
The Padlock, The Notepad and The File Folder is actually Windows Emojis that I found using the *Windows*+*.* Shortcut

## Here are the most totally useful things that I am too lazy or it's hard to implement:
- Storage System
- The Time and Date Section
- An Alarm System
- A Login System
- A Easy to find and Debug JavaScript Console System that I am lazy to implement
